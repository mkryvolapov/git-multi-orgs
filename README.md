# 🧩 git-multi-orgs

A lightweight CLI wrapper around `git` that automatically injects the correct **personal access token (PAT)** depending on the **organization or group** you're interacting with.

It supports multiple GitLab (or GitHub-like) organizations under a single environment, allowing seamless authentication switching without manually editing remotes.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔑 Automatically selects the correct token per organization or group.
- ⚙️ Compatible with **GitLab**, **GitHub**, and other HTTPS-based Git servers.
- 🧠 Works transparently with all `git` commands (`clone`, `push`, `pull`, `fetch`).
- 🐚 Supports Bash, Zsh, and Fish shells.
- 🪶 Zero dependencies beyond Python 3 and standard Unix tools.
